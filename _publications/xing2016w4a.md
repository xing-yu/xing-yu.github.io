The rapid accumulation of user generated content on the Internet provides researchers with abundant information to extract knowledge from. It also provides HCI and accessibility practitioners with a new direction to explore and understand users requirements beyond traditional approaches. In my work, I create a tool that consists of both text-mining and machining learning methods to extract essential focuses of design out of the data collected from social networks. This tool can be used at the initial stage of a product design life-cycle by designers to collect key design aspects at a fairly low cost.
