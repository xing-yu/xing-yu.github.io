In this study, we have teamed up with a large e-commerce website, Walmart.com, and analyzed one-day search logs in 2014. Different measures were compared among three different types of devicesâ€”desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. The discrepancies as well as similarities regarding search time, search location, click behaviors, and query behaviors are reported. The implications of the findings and the future work are discussed at the end.
