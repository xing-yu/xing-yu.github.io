Hi! I'm Xing(pronounced as /shi:n/). I am a machine learning engineer at [Meta](https://www.meta.com). Before becoming an MLE, I worked at a consulting company as a data scientist for 4 years.

I received my doctoral at the [IU School of Informatics and Computing at Indianapolis](https://luddy.indianapolis.iu.edu/index.html). My research focused on improving the well-being of people with disabilities with my advisor [Erin Brady](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/brady/).
