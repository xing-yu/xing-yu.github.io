Hi! I'm Xing(pronounced as /shi:n/). And I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [IU School of Informatics and Computing at Indianapolis](https://soic.iupui.edu). I'm an accessibility researcher who works on improving the well-being of people with disabilities with my advisor [Erin Brady](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/brady/). I try to explore the possibility of utilizing the information on social media websites to better understand people with disabilities and inform better design of assistive technologies. Luckly, my expertise in computer science allows me to use both qualitative interpretation and computational modeling to understand how people with disabilities use social media as well as capturing the valuable information from user-generated data. And the ultimate goal of my work is to devise a tool that utilize social midea websites as a data source to support accessibility researchers.
